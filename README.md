API stands for **Application programming interface**, API is a building block of many software that we use in our day-to-day life, API makes it possible of sharing resources and services with different applications.

## Why APIs are important?

- API allows developers to easily build something exciting and innovative without the need of reinventing the wheel.

> Example: If developers want to build a weather dashboard then they can directly use the Weather API.

- API opens doors for innovations

> Example: Applications can use existing product data(Twitter/Facebook) with the help of APIs and build something innovative.

- API can make business

> Example: APIs can be used as software as a service business (like Twilio APIs)

## Who works with APIs?

APIs can be used by anyone whether it's a developer or non-developer, according to the [Postman Survey](https://www.postman.com/state-of-api/) APIs are used by people such as **educators**, **researchers**, **data analysts** and many more.

## Who benefits from APIs?

The simple answer is **Everyone**, directly or indirectly everyone benefits from APIs in day-to-day life.

## Types of APIs

APIs types are based on there things

- Medium
- Architectures
- Accessibility


### Medium

- Hardware APIs
Interface for software to talk to hardware.

> Example: How your phone's camera talks to the operating system. 

- Software Library APIs
Interface for directly consuming code from another code base.

> Example: Using methods from a library you import into your application.

- Web APIs
Interface for communicating across code bases over a network.

> Example: Fetching current stock prices from a finance API over the internet.

#### Multiple API types may be used to achieve a task. For example, uploading a photo to Instagram makes use of various APIs:

- **Hardware API** for the app to talk to your camera

- **Software library API** for the image to be processed with filters

- **Web API** for sending your image to Instagram's servers so your friends can like it!

### Architectures

There is more than one way to build and consume APIs. Some architecture types you may come across are:

- REST (Representational State Transfer)
- GraphQL
- WebSockets
- webhooks
- SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
- gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)

### Accessibility

APIs also vary in the scope of who can access them.

- Public APIs (aka Open APIs)
Consumed by anyone who discovers the API

- Private APIs
Consumed only within an organization and not made public

- Partner APIs
Consumed between one or more organizations that have an established relationship
